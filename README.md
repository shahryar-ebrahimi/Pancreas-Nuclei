# Pancreas-Nuclei
A MATLAB code for accurate nuclei identification in pancreas tissue sample scan

Pathology is a scientific discipline that examines the cause and impact of diseases based on tissue samples under a microscope. 
The evaluation of tissue samples, which is done visually under a microscope, is subjective and may vary among pathologists. 
Therefore, providing a quantitative method in tissue analysis can be useful in diagnosis and prediction. 
Here, we apply a series of algorithms for nucleus identification in tissue samples that have been stained using the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining method.
